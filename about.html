    <p class="about"> 
        Early on I found curiosity for music and sound which led me into a world of creation. On this site you can find examples of my works/projects from over the years. These include various tracks, rescored movie clips, photographs, visual creations, remixes and even a synth coded completely in javascript. I studied Music Technology student at Temple university but currently am unable to finish due to financial issues.

        Nonetheless, nothing stops the journey of creation.</p>
